        <div id="text-div-1"><h1>Distribution and Location</h1><p>Classified as one of two subspecies of western gorilla (the western lowland gorilla being the other), Cross River gorillas inhabit the lowland montane forests and rainforests of Cameroon and Nigeria, an area of 3,000 square miles (7,770 sq km), on the African continent. Scientists have identified 11 family groups (or troops) living in eight sites across this rugged, hilly terrain in overlapping home ranges.</p>

      <div id="text-div-2"><h1>Population Separation</h1>
             <p>The Cross River gorilla subpopulations are separated from each other by human settlements, and these settlements give the gorilla no room to expand. Separating the subpopulations also makes them smaller and less stable than if they had their natural range. Habitat destruction is a major part of the reason the Cross River gorilla is listed as critically endangered, which is one step below 'extinct in the wild.'</p></div>

              <h1>Preference vs Restriction</h1>
              <p>The gorillas can sometimes be found in lowland forests, but they tend to stay at higher altitudes. This restriction is most likely because humans are more concentrated in the lowland areas. The gorillas have moved into the higher altitudes to avoid humans, as opposed to living there because of a natural preference for high elevation.</p><h2>Highlands</h2><p>The terrain is mountainous, with many steep valleys and rugged slopes. Altitude varies from 200 to 2037m, with the gorillas mainly sticking to the inaccessible highlands, where they remain relatively undisturbed. They donâ€™t seem to have any strong habitat preferences within their range, and have probably been pushed into this restricted distribution by hunting in the past. Reports of sightings imply that the gorillas tend to move to higher ground during the wet season, and come down into the valleys more during the dry season.</p><h2>Lowlands</h2><p>The lowland forest is moist, semi-deciduous rainforest. Above 700-800m this becomes sub-montane forest, which itself transforms into montane forest above about 1500m. The Cross River National Park, where some of the gorillas live, contains a rare continuum between all three types of forest. Large areas of primary forest still remain in this region, but some of the gorillas live within small, fairly isolated pockets. Most of the sites which the gorillas inhabit are connected by forest, though these corridors are often tenuous. </p> </div>
